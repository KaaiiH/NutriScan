# NutriScan
***Proj for ENED 1200

This App allows someone to scan the food on their plate and know what is it they need for a balanced **Dinner**. It will tell them what they need more of and it will direct them to the nearest store where they can find what they need.

**UPDATE
The Google Cloud API key to use google maps to direct the person to the store is no longer active so it will default to a specific kroger in Columbus.
